1.0.0 (2016-05-11)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Version sent to A&A

1.1.0 (2016-05-11)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 Changed definition of third-light contribution to be more intuitive.

1.2.0 (2016-05-11)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 Added clean exit if polynomial root finding step fails in ell_ell_intersect,
 and raised warning for cases where results may be inaccurate due to
 root-polishing convergence problems.

1.3.0 (2016-05-11)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 Added test to catch rare case in module ellipse, subroutine ell_ell_intersect
 where test for tangent/intersection point fails because one of the mid-points 
 between the intersection/tangent points is also a tangent point (or nearly 
 so).

1.4.0 (2016-05-24)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 Added speed-up to ellc.rv() for flux_weight=False.

 Avoided stop in ell_ell_intersect when ellipse intersection algorithm fails.

1.4.2 (2016-06-09)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 Avoided problems with NaNs returned in rare cases where the spot is on the
 limb but no tangent points are defined for the projected ellipse.
 Also removed stop for the case ntouch > 4.
 Corrected first line of doc string for rv() (Errors spotted by Bogumil Pilecki)
 Correct bug in ellc.rv() - calculation of rv for iobs=0 can cause crash

1.4.3 (2016-06-21)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 Corrected bug in calculation of simplified reflection  
 Corrected bug in calculation of flux-weighted radial velocity for stars with
 detailed reflection.
 Added check for flux_weighted radial velocity combined with simplified
 reflection in rv().

1.5.0 (2016-09-26)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 Revised coordinate systems used internally.  This is needed for a consistent
 fix to a bug in RM effect in 1.4.3 and a bug in the flux-weighted radial
 velocity when using detailed reflection.

 Added module coords.f90

 Added GD448_rv.py to examples/GD448 to test RV+heating calculations.

 Added notes/figures on coordinate systems in subdirectory doc/.

 Fixed bug initialisation of vsini_2 value in lc.py and rv.py. This changes
 the output of examples/PhotRM/PhotRM.py

 Improved calculation of gravity in the exact_grav case - now done on the
 Roche equipotential at the same angular coordinate as the ellipsoid surface.

 Added option to use an improved calculation of ellipsoid size for Roche
 potential case so that volume of the Roche equipotential surface is constant
 in an eccentric orbit and is equal to the volume of a sphere with radius
 specified by the user. With the star model "roche", the volume is calculated
 either the volume of the approximating ellipsoid. For synchronous rotation
 only, the new star shape model "roche_v" uses equation (2.18) from Kopal
 "Dynamics of Close Binary Systems" (Springer, 1978) to calculate the volume
 enclosed by the equipotential surface. This makes very little difference
 unless the star is very distorted and is slower.

 Made printing of parameters python3 compatible in J0113+31.py

 Made use of priors in ellc_emcee python3 safe.
 Added "import setuptools" to setup.py

1.5.5 (2016-11-30)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 Removed "import setuptools" from setup.py - breaks installation from pypi
