      "  (rotation period = orbital period) not pseudo-synchronous rotation rate.\n",

      "    The effect of the spot on the light curve is calculated using the\n",
      "   algorithm by Eker [2] for circular spots on a spherical star with\n",
      "   quadratic limb darkening. If the limb-darkening law used for the main\n",
      "   calculation is not linear or quadratic then the coefficients of the\n",
      "   limb-darkening law used for the calculation of the effects of the spots\n",
      "   are set so that the intensity distribution matches at mu = 0, 0.5 and 1.\n",

      "    N.B. The effect of each spot on the light curve is additive so overlapping\n",
      "   spots can result in non-physical negative fluxes for some regions of the\n",

      "    For the calculation of the star shape, the rotation and orbital angular\n",
      "   momentum vectors are assumed parallel. The shape of each star is\n",
      "   approximated by a triaxial ellipsoid with semi-major axes (A,B,C) and\n",

      "   that intersection points of the triaxial ellipsoid with x-, y- and z-axes\n",
      "   lie on an equipotential surface. For the options \"poly1p5\" and \"poly3p0\"\n",
